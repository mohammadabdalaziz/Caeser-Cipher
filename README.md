# Caeser-Cipher

# Project Overview
This project provides a Bash script to perform both encoding and decoding of text using the Caesar cipher. The Caesar cipher is a classic substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted by a specified number of positions within the alphabet, allowing for simple encryption and decryption.

# Features
Encoding: Encrypts plaintext by shifting each letter by a user-defined number of positions.
Decoding: Decrypts ciphertext back to plaintext by reversing the shift.
Flexible Shift Value: Allows for both positive (right) and negative (left) shifts in the alphabet.
