# Caeser-Cipher

This project provides a Bash script to perform both encoding and decoding of text using the Caesar cipher. The Caesar cipher is a classic substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted by a specified number of positions within the alphabet, allowing for simple encryption and decryption.
